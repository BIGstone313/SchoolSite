      <h2>Info</h2>
      <p>Advance Robots took people to put them in these flying domes in space. These people have to survive with dinosuars. The only way off the ark is to defeat bosses and go through the tek cave. After the survivors go through the tek cave the end up in a desert ark where they find out more dinosuars exist like the wyvern and thorney dragon. The survivors defeat the scorched ark boss and end up in a cave system ark. Which they where suppose to stay and die there. Rockwell infused raw element inside his blood veins and became a monster. the other survivors must defeat him. After they defeated Rockwell the survivors teleported back to earth. Earth is in ruins and corruption has spreed through out the land.
